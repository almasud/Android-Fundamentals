/**
 * Everything is happening in the UI thread (also called "main" thread),
 * performing long operations such as network access or database queries will
 * block the whole UI. When the thread is blocked, no events can be dispatched,
 * including drawing events. From the user's perspective, the application
 * appears to hang. Even worse, if the UI thread is blocked for more than a
 * few seconds (about 5 seconds currently) the user is presented with the
 * infamous "application not responding" (ANR) dialog. The user might then
 * decide to quit your application and uninstall it if they are unhappy.
 * Additionally, the Android UI toolkit is not thread-safe. So, you must not
 * manipulate your UI from a worker thread ("background" thread)â€”you must do
 * all manipulation to your user interface from the UI thread. Thus, there
 * are simply two rules to Android's single thread model:
 *
 *    1. Do not block the UI thread
 *    2. Do not access the Android UI toolkit from outside the UI thread
 *
 * If you have operations to perform that are not instantaneous, you should
 * make sure to do them in separate threads ("background" or "worker" threads).
 * However, note that you cannot update the UI from any thread other than the
 * UI thread or the "main" thread. To fix this problem, Android offers several
 * ways to access the UI thread from other threads.
